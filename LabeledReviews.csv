"The phone does NOT work right, and never has. Sure, you can call out on it, and you can receive calls BUT ....no one can HEAR YOUR VOICE ... unless you switch the speaker phone on! That part is not working right, and it has not since the day we received it. This was a gift for someone without a phone at all, and now she has one that only works halfway! NOT RIGHT! Ive written the Seller already and now have submitted a claim via Amazon too. So far, the Seller is NOT returning emails or calls. Maybe Amazon itself will have better luck -- and if not, perhaps this store does not need to be an Amazon store at all.Lets see if they answer this, the THIRD request for replacement! A full replacement or even a full return of funds in the next 24 hours would certainly be welcome since we thought we bought a WORKING CELL phone. This one does not work right, period. we demand a replacement that works or a full refund within the next ten(10) days.too coslty and very bad camera and pictures were not good.",Negative,Camera,2
"This is my first apple product ever. I had been wanting one for years but this was in my price range. A lot of my friends have the 5 or 5s and all suggested I start with the 4 since they feel the ios system is better on it. The phone I got was used, but looks near to new. Only a few extremely light scratches that you cant even see when looking directly at it. Screen is average and camera is not too bad it is just fine.",Neutral,Screen,3

"Got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days, on the negative side, folks dont get my texts sometimes, or I dont get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when Ive only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. Im going back to my android smart phone. This one is garbage, sorry I bought it.battery is draining very fast and worst battery.",Negative,Battery,2
"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, theres no way to get this iphone off the list.

Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent. Keyboard is working fine and also screen quality also good.,Positive,Screen,4
"Bought this as a replacement to my broken 8GB iPhone. If you already own an iPhone then you know how useful and widely owned these are. if you dont have one, Apple products, while seemingly fragile, do work extremely well for a long time in terms of performance and durability. I never knew someone who had a physically defective apple anything after any given amount of time. These things do not fall apart ever.very good mobile  and fantastic camera , i loved the pictures.",Positive,Camera,4
The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product,Neutral,Screen,3

"this is one of the worst products ive ever bought from Apple ive had it encased in a otter box for protection and upkeep and it still regularly blips out. so far as the battery is concerned it regularly abruptly dies even if one moment before it reads 40-50% power, and the power button stopped working soon after i got it. do yourself a favor if youre considering apple for a phone just go with Samsung, LG, or something else. its not worth the faulty poor quality and headaches this one will bring you.Price is too hight and it is not worth it . I have wasted my  money. Poor battery life.",Negative,Battery,1
"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition.",Positive,Battery,3

"Battery lasted 6 months... do not recommend. This phone has a problem with the screen touch. Many times, it will not recognize Im pressing a button on the screen. However, it will constantly think my ear is a button. Its VERY annoying!. I dont recommend buying this phone from this company.",Positive,Battery,5
"My iPhone was bought from used powerbookmac.com & it is flawless no scratches or scuffs.i had my phone unlocked from third party vender(60 bucks).because they had no pervious owner info they buy then in bulk.but you can still unlock it through a third party vender. But all in all my iPhone is great the best phone I ever had. Its my first iPhone and for used the shot I took was right on the money. Fast, smooth, clean & crisp like an iPhone is. Buy from the vender if possible. Very good camera and battery.",Positive,Battery,4
Was worried about buying a used phone. Im very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it! I have clicked amazing pictures.,Positive,Camera,4
"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,display is not good and screen is very bad .",Negative,Screen,2
Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon.i loved the photos quality of this phone.,Positive,Camera,4
The phone was in excellent condition and we have had no issues with it. The charger stopped working about a week later. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience.,Positive,Battery,3

"The product was advertised as ...""IPHONE 4 32GB BLACK.UNLOCKED USING TURBO SIM . UNLOCKED TO USE FOR ANY CARRIER. NEW CONDITION AND COMES WITH ALL ACCESSORIES: WALL CHARGER, USB CABLE, and HEADPHONES.This phone is Brand new, with box, charger and earbuds . The phone is unlocked using Gevey""The phone works fine, but I took it to t-mobile, and they said it was locked. Also, it appears to be the 04.11.08 baseband, which is apparently more difficult to unlock than most.Sent an email, but no response after a couple of days.battery and charger is just average.",Neutral,Battery,2
"Phone was a great purchase, was in great condition no scratches came in an iphone 4 box which was a nice touch.",Positive,Screen,4
Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM. Screen glass broke and camera quality is not good.,Negative,Screen,1
I love this phone. Granted Im always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. Its a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too. I use a bluetooth stereo headset at the gym which allows me to play music while keeping my phone safely in the gym bag. Yes apple products a bit expensive but they are darn fun and good. No preinstalled junk apps. Screen is good.,Positive,Screen,3
Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches on the screen. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when its stuck it wont even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isnt draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape.,Neutral,Screen,2
The phone got very hot when charging. Im requesting a full refund and a return shipping label. I do not expect to pay for return cost. Battery is worst,Negative,Battery,1
"its all right , the only problem with it is just like all iPhones is : the home button will partially stop working. Battery is bad and camera is good.",Neutral,Camera,3
"I bought this used phone as a Christmas gift and when my wife got around to activating it, it didnt work. Now Amazon was top notch on getting me the cost of the phone and my shipping back but for some reason couldnt get my sales tax back? What kinda ship is that? A full refund is a full refund not a shipping and cost of the phone only refund! The girl who sold the phone had to of known that the phone was defective cause her so called return policy was like 1 or 2 weeks and that was roughly the shipping time. She acted like she had no clue it was defective and told me to bad its not her policy to take stuff back after that time I shouldve told her sooner. Thank You Amazon for your standards I just wish that you would have gotten me a FULL refund!! Really had worst experience during my travelling. Worst battery life.",Negative,Battery,1
"Good pictures and love it, I recomend, Not the best deal $300 but its fair.I dont want any contract and new is too expensive.",Neutral,Camera,3
"Like the title says, Apple products rock! 32GB is currently proving to be more than what I need to store all of my music and apps. I also have a charger-case so my phone lasts throughout the entire day. The phone uses micro sim cards by AT&T as well as T-mobile. I am currently ordering a sim card cutter from Amazon in order to resize the sim card from Straight Talk because Straight Talk does not have micro sim cards anymore.Very good storage capacity and picture quality.",Positive,Camera,4

"Even though the iPhone 6 will be out soon, I fell in love with this phone camera. The processor makes everything super quick, and even though non-market apps are much easier to obtain on an Android, I find that the versatility of the iPhone makes up for it",Positive,Camera,4
"Bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Phone came quickly, and I was surprised at the great condition it was in when I received it. The ""cosmetic damage"" was negligible to the point that it looked like a new phone, even though the condition was rated as ""good"". After a few hours of operation I noticed a significant problem with the home button and am sending it back. Going to try my luck with a different AWD iphone.worst battery life. It is taking lot of time to get charged and draining very fast.",Negative,Battery,2

"It is very nice, only issue is it cannot be unlocked due to it is non-full price of purchase. I was told before, if I bought at&t, i can use t-mobile prepaid card. but because of the price, i cannot. Otherwise, this is very helpful cell phone. can you tell me how to recharge the money for each month? which phone number to call for at&t prepaid card? thanks. Not a good display screen and the keyboard is also bad.",Neutral,Screen,3
The iphone came like in a week and a half and the screen came cracked and the iphone doesnt even work it stays on the apple screen is worst.,Negative,Screen,1
"I wanted the Iphone 4 without being attached to a contract with a carrier so I decided to buy on Amazon. I was so surprised when I received the phone. It was flawless; no scratches or dings looks like new. The phone works very well and came with the apple charger which works very fine, apple ear phones, documentation, and apple stickers. It shipped from the Amazon Warehouse and I am very pleased with this purchase. Camera is good.",Positive,Camera,4
IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I dont see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that. screen was not bigger enough,Negative,Screen,1
"Loving my phone and fantastic picture and camera quality. Was even better with Siri, but I lose her with the upgrade, could hardly wait for the new jailbreak to get her back. I suggest if you intend to sell your phones again take Advantage of the protective covers. Sense this I have gotten a number of items through Amazon",Positive,Camera,4
"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you dont need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get ""The Otter Box case"" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back.

I bought this iPhone 2 years ago and Im still using it it came like the info said and like the pictures I recommend anyone getting iphone 4 go hereI just now figured out the ratings and reviews sorry took so long get backWith everyone. battery perfomance was also fine,Positive,Battery,4
"Went with an iphone 4 32gb when my ipod 5th generation video finally bit the dust. I can say that Im very happy with this phone, the call quality, bluetooth quality, and music quality are all excellent. In addition I recently added a Paypal card swipe which is something I could not have done with my old phone.Very easy to get used to after a few days, and the battery life is astounding. Later model iPhones have a special feature with the recently released OS to sync with newer cars better. I might upgrade my phone if I ever get a new car, but for now the used iPhone 4 I have works great with my old cars aftermarket JVC stereo (purchased probably 4 years ago!) USB interface and Im totally satisfied with my purchase.the screen glass is very fine and good.",Positive,Screen,5
can you help me to unlock it because it does not work in Venezuela. I await your prompt response thanks.The camera quality was also at par but was not excellent.,Neutral,Camera,3
Everything is really good excpet the battery life doesnot lasts long at all,Negative,Battery,2
The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it wont stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying,Negative,Battery,1
"The fineness also good, no problem on the phone functions.Official unlock also very cheap, about $ 1.Unlock the future is very easy to use and the Price was also really in my budget",Positive,Battery,5
The only thing bad about the phone was that it had a sticky home button which was not stated when I purchased it. Super disappointing. poor screen and it is very costly.,Negative,Screen,1
"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. Ive had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, Ive bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazons Customer Service. Theyve always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. Theyve definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriends Christmas. Screen is bad.",Negative,Screen,1

After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department. Excellent screen and display.",Positive,Screen,4
Loved it like new . Phone came in factory box with brand new head phones and charger. I would definitely purchase another. No scratches,Positive,Battery,4
"The person who sold it to was very polite and reputable, with everything that they said about the iPhone 4. Would buy from them again.i loved the camera and picture quality.",Positive,Camera,5
"I bought this phone over 30 days ago and so, far so good. I was a bit leary about purchasing a used iPhone, but things worked out for the best with this product. It came unlocked and configured for ATT service as decribed in the add. There were NO scratches on the phone and it was packaged in the original Apple box with all the accessories included. It looks and works like brand new. This product definitely looks and works better than all the other used iPhones I saw for sale.

"Couldnt be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well.",Positive,Camera,4
This is all I expected ! Works great looks new I got it on time and didnt have to worry about if it was a fake phone. The camera and pictures talks all about the phone efficiency.,Positive,Camera,4
I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didnt look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if its the software that unlocked it or if thats just the iphones quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time and the battery backup was also not that good,Negative,Battery,1
The phone was working fine at first but then we noticed cracks on the back of the phone . Then one morning i checked my phone and it was not turning on the only thing on the screen.was ios6 i took it to an apple store to see if they could fix the problem but they said it was a used item and there was replaced parts in the phone Along with missing screws. When i purchased the phone the statement said the phone was new thats the only reason why i had ordered it .,Negative,Screen,1
"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. Im using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time.",Negative,Battery,1
"I received my phone on time, but, the phone has noticeable pixels that are moving on the bottom constantly. As if the phone had been broken at some point. Also, there was a circle of dim light cutting off the corners on my screen fully around the screen. Also, I had it brought to tmobile and found out that it was unlocked so that was a plus. THE WORST PART OF ALL WAS... I wasnt allowed to call people, my phone eventually after four months it stopped letting me call people. Another unfortunate error was that I couldnt send pictures to someone who didnt have an iPhone. So overall, you are better off saving your money and looking for a better seller, or goto an actual phone store. You really cant trust people online.",Neutral,Screen,2
"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the screen was a great. No problems what so ever.",Positive,Screen,4
"I received this iPhone 4 and checked it out as soon as i unboxed it, the screen was in perfect condition and the back of the phone was pretty good too only one scratch in the glass, i noticed that the white water damage stickers were removed out of the headphone slot and the charging port. I activated this phone and it worked very well until last night it started to randomly shut down on me and now it will not come on at all or charge!! I received this phone straight from amazon warehouse so i thought it was a safe bet, whats going on amazon??? we have to do better than this! $260 for a lemon.",Positive,Screen,5
"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen. keyboard is fine.",Positive,Screen,5
"To all prospective Iphone lookers,When i was looking for an Iphone 4 for my friend as a gift, i almost ended up paying about 350$+ for new one. At last i thought about giving this one a try and i must say, its worth every penny.First of, it looks 95% new, let me emphasize on that number. Battery is great, Screen is spot/scratch less, i found maybe a hairline scratch on the side less than few mm long, almost invisible from few feets away. Being a past ATT user, i was able to unlock it for free in about 7 days.On the whole, it was one of best Refurbished/Used i have ever bought for anyone. Never been much of Used electronics enthusiast but this purchase might change my view for future.( Lets hope not ) :)Cheers!",Neutral,Camera,3
"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speakers filter is missing. Second, camera flash does not work.

Dont be fooled when I opened the package I was super excited the phone looked brand new! The first day everything worked and seemed great then my phone would go black and turn off.also it would freeze and get super hot. There charger they supply you with does not work so for 266$ I feel was a big rip off dont be fooled be careful when buying a phone from companies like this and also AT&T had a hard time putting the phone ID in as well. Never again this product was a too good to be true!,Negative,Battery,2
"buyer beware I bought three phones from amazon three different phone one for att, one for straight talk and one for Verizon . they are all junk my att phone broke in three weeks, my daughters phone for Verizon has more problems than I can list is basically unuseable, and my sons phone which is the one I am reviewing works but freezes, hangs up and other stuff and he has had it about four weeks.

After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item.

Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon.i loved the photos quality of this phone.,Positive,Camera,4

Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too...

I love this phone. Granted Im always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. Its a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too.

No preinstalled junk apps. Screen is good.,Positive,Screen,3
Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches on the screen. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when its stuck it wont even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isnt draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape.,Neutral,Screen,2

A full refund is a full refund not a shipping and cost of the phone only refund! The girl who sold the phone had to of known that the phone was defective cause her so called return policy was like 1 or 2 weeks and that was roughly the shipping time. She acted like she had no clue it was defective and told me to bad its not her policy to take stuff back after that time I shouldve told her sooner.

"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you dont need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get ""The Otter Box case"" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back.

Never again this product was a too good to be true!,Negative,Battery,2

Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon.i loved the photos quality of this phone.,Positive,Camera,4

I love this phone. Granted Im always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. Its a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too.

No preinstalled junk apps. Screen is good.,Positive,Screen,3
Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches on the screen. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when its stuck it wont even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isnt draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape.,Neutral,Screen,2

The girl who sold the phone had to of known that the phone was defective cause her so called return policy was like 1 or 2 weeks and that was roughly the shipping time. She acted like she had no clue it was defective and told me to bad its not her policy to take stuff back after that time I shouldve told her sooner.

"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T.

The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days.
